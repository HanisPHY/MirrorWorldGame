## Something else
* I designed and implemented this game with the help of AI tools, particularly ChatGPT. While I brainstormed most of my ideas on my own, I primarily relied on ChatGPT to generate the code during implementation. 
* This is a 24-hour project, and I will likely update it in the future to add more levels, fix bugs, and enhance the overall experience.
